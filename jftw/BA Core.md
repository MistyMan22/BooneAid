**Summary/Title:** BooneAid core task object

**Description:** BooneAid is an online database of resources in the Boone NC for people in need. It will have functions for creating/updating/deleting pages for different resources. It will have a search function that will filter resources based on parameters about the person (age, gender, disabilities, etc), and the need they have (financial assistance, counseling, healthcare, etc). 

**Acceptance Test:** 
- [ ] database created with the [[resources]] Jessica has already put together
- [ ] website that can be used to display the database with slick design
- [ ] admin login that can be used to CUD resources from the database
- [ ] search with filters for type of person and need they have
- [ ] website hosted somewhere where it is publicly available

**Value:** 1

**Motivation (why are you doing this?):** 
[[Jessica]] needs to do a project for the community. She has put together a list of resources that she can hand out to her patients. The physical copy has ~30 pages. It's expensive to copy and difficult to search. It's impossible to update without a lot of effort. An online resource solves those problems. 

**Impact**
If this resource can help 1 person in need get the help they need, it will be worth it.
