Central Question:
- How does the URL map to what components are visible?

booneaid.com/home
booneaid.com/about
booneaid.com/resource/r5Y5eJ
booneaid.com/searchresult?gender=woman&age=20to30&lookingfor=healthcare

^ those are the main ones. How do I make the visible components map to paths like that?

- going to search "React Routing," BRB
	- "React Router" seems to be the top result
	- The first two are probably pretty easy (simple map to one component)
	- The third is more complex, does that hash result in a call to the database?
	- The last may be a separate thing entirely
	- In general, I don't really understand how these url paths work
	- I dont understand the difference between BrowserRouter and HashRouter
